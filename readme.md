# Event Booking System API

A RESTful API for managing users, events, and bookings built using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL. This API supports secure user authentication, event creation, and booking with role-based access control for (admin || user).

## üìÅ Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- Sequelize (ORM)
- PostgreSQL
- JWT (Authentication)
- Swagger (API Documentation)

---

## üìö API Overview

### Authentication & Roles

- Users can sign up and log in.
- JWT tokens are issued upon login and stored in HTTP-only cookies.
- Two roles:
  - `user`: Can book events and can view and delete their own bookings.
  - `admin`: Can create, update, and delete events. Can also manage all bookings and users.

---

## üîê Middleware

- **`isLoggedIn`**: Verifies the presence and validity of JWT in cookies.
- **`isAdmin`**: Grants access to admin-only routes.
- **`authorizeUserOrAdmin`**: Allows access if the logged-in user is an admin or the owner of the resource (based on `userId` or `bookingId`).

## üîÑ Workflow Overview

### User Workflow

1. Signup using `/users/signup`
2. Login using `/users/login` ‚Üí JWT cookie issued
3. Access profile using `/users/:userId` or update/delete
4. Logout with `/users/logout`

### Admin Workflow

1. Login as admin
2. Create/update/delete events via `/events`
3. View or manage all users and bookings


## ü™ë Seat Management & Booking Flow

1. **Booking an Event:**
   - A user books a number of seats via `/bookings`.
   - The system checks:
     - If requested seats are available.
     - If total available seats ‚â• seats requested.
     - That seats cannot be negative or overbooked.
   - Updates `event.availableSeats` by subtracting the booked count.

2. **Updating a Booking:**
   - Adds previously booked seats back to availability.
   - Re-checks new seat count against `event.availableSeats`.
   - Applies new booking if seats are valid.
   - Ensures total seats never go negative.

3. **Updating an Event:**
   - When updating `totalSeats`:
     - Calculates already booked seats.
     - Ensures new total is not less than already booked seats.
     - Dynamically recalculates `availableSeats`.

4. **Deleting a Booking:**
   - Cancels booking and re-adds booked seats to `event.availableSeats`.

5. **Deleting a User or Event:**
   - Automatically removes all related bookings.
   - Prevents orphan records and preserves data integrity.

4. Users can manage their own bookings
5. Number of seats are handled and calculated:
   - No overbooking
   - No negative availability
   - Safe recalculation of seats during update/delete
